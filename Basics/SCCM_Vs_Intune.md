**Can we combine two technologies together? <br/> <br/>
Yes, with Co-Management**: We can now combine the cloud-based (Intune) and on-premises (SCCM/MECM) technologies by appropriate configuration to achieve Windows Autopilot **Co-Management**. With this, pull-off the management of Windows and Mobile Devices under one roof. Microsoft continues to state that Intune and SCCM will both co-exist in the future under the Endpoint Manager product family. With that in mind, it’s important to implement a co-management strategy that uses both solutions and applies them based on use case – i.e. SCCM for desktop deliveries and Intune for mobile device management.
